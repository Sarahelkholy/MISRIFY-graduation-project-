# MISRIFY â€“ Graduation Project (Mobile App + Backend Integration)

> **Note on authorship:** I built **only the Flutter mobile app** and **connected it to the existing backend**.  
> The server code/configs belong to the team project; my scope here is the mobile client and API integration.

## âœ¨ Overview

MISRIFY is a mobile e-commerce experience built with **Flutter**.  
The app features onboarding, authentication, product catalog, cart, wishlist, checkout, notifications, and profile management.  
It consumes REST APIs from a Node.js/Express backend (MongoDB, JWT, Redis, Stripe/Paymob, Cloudinary, Nodemailer).
